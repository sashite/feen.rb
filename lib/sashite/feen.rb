module Sashite
  # FEEN (Forsythâ€“Edwards Enhanced Notation) module provides parsing and dumping
  # functionality for board game positions.
  #
  # FEEN is a universal, rule-agnostic notation for representing board game positions.
  # It extends traditional FEN to support multiple game systems, cross-style games,
  # multi-dimensional boards, and captured pieces.
  #
  # A FEEN string consists of three space-separated fields:
  # 1. Piece placement: Board configuration using EPIN notation
  # 2. Pieces in hand: Captured pieces held by each player
  # 3. Style-turn: Game styles and active player
  #
  # @see https://sashite.dev/specs/feen/1.0.0/
  module Feen
    # Dump a Position object into its canonical FEEN string representation.
    #
    # Generates a deterministic FEEN string from a position object. The same
    # position will always produce the same canonical string, ensuring
    # position equality can be tested via string comparison.
    #
    # @param position [Position] A position object with placement, hands, and styles
    # @return [String] Canonical FEEN notation string
    #
    # @example Dump a position to FEEN
    #   feen_string = Sashite::Feen.dump(position)
    #   # => "+rnbq+kbn+r/+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p/8/8/8/8/+P+P+P+P+P+P+P+P/+RNBQ+KBN+R / C/c"
    #
    # @example Round-trip parsing and dumping
    #   original = "+rnbq+kbn+r/+p+p+p+p+p+p+p+p/8/8/8/8/+P+P+P+P+P+P+P+P/+RNBQ+KBN+R / C/c"

    #
    # @example Parse a shogi position with captured pieces
