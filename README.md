> __FEEN__ (Forsythâ€“Edwards Expanded Notation) support for the Ruby language.

## Overview

This is an implementation of [FEEN](https://developer.sashite.com/specs/forsyth-edwards-expanded-notation), a generic format that can be used for serializing and deserializing chess positions.

The main chess variants are supported, including [Chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chess), [Janggi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggi), [Makruk](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Makruk), [Shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shogi), [Xiangqi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xiangqi).

More exotic variants are also supported, like: [Dai dai shogi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dai_dai_shogi), [Four-player chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Four-player_chess), or [Three-dimensional chess](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three-dimensional_chess) ðŸ––

gem "feen"
```

And then execute:

```sh
bundle
```

Or install it yourself as:

```sh
gem install feen
```

## Usage

```ruby
require "feen"

# Dump a classic Tsume Shogi problem
FEEN.dump(
  in_hand: %w[S r r b g g g g s n n n n p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p p],
  shape: [9, 9],
  side_id: 0,
  square: {
    3 => "s",
    4 => "k",
    5 => "s",
    22 => "+P",
    43 => "+B"
  }
)
# => "3,s,k,s,3/9/4,+P,4/9/7,+B,1/9/9/9/9 0 S,b,g,g,g,g,n,n,n,n,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,r,r,s"

# Parse a classic Tsume Shogi problem
FEEN.parse("3,s,k,s,3/9/4,+P,4/9/7,+B,1/9/9/9/9 0 S,b,g,g,g,g,n,n,n,n,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,p,r,r,s")
# => {:square=>{3=>"s", 4=>"k", 5=>"s", 22=>"+P", 43=>"+B"}, :shape=>[9, 9], :in_hand=>["S", "b", "g", "g", "g", "g", "n", "n", "n", "n", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "p", "r", "r", "s"], :side_id=>0}
